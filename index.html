        <h2 id="why">The Why</h2>
        <p>Like most people, I dont want to be stuck at a job
        i don't like. As they say do a job that you love and you 
        never have to work a day in your life. Sounds easy if you
        if you know what you love and that love bears fruit.<br>
        Now i dont know what i love. At some point i knew what i 
        wanted to do but as i was pursuing on that journey i 
        realised, that i dont truly love it but i just liked to
        do it. If i kept on going on that journey, i didn't see 
        myself happy or fullfilled at the end of that tunel. "If 
        i'm going to try go all the way" -Charles Bukowski. Now 
        I had to find something else that can let me have free 
        time to do my other projets, while still doing what i
        like. <br>

        Nothing else fits better than a programmer. Specifically
        Full stack developper. If its not full stack than i can 
        jump to data analysist or so on. It can help me 
        greatly on my other projects as well. And what i found 
        surprisingly is that it also helps me understand the mind
        . Its sounds too good to be true.

        <p>
        Since i already knew a little bit of python. I dicided 
        to start with back-end than front-end in order to 
        become a full stack dev.
        <br>The most importnat is to start doing it and keep
        going.
